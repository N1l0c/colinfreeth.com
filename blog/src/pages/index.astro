			<h1>This is a place for ideas in motion.</h1>
			<p>
				A space where philosophy meets complexity, where music shapes thought, and thought reshapes sound.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here you'll find sketches, essays, experiments, and unfinished symphoniesâ€”  
				threads from different worlds weaving toward something whole.
			</p>
			<p>
				Welcome.<br />
				You're invited to read, listen, play, and respond.
