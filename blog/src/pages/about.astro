		I’m Colin — a multi-modal musician, improviser, and creative technologist working with sound, code, and lived complexity.
	</p>

	<p>
		My work lives in the tension between structure and emergence, logic and feel, noise and signal. It moves between disciplines without seeking to unify them — more rhizome than roadmap, more patchwork than product. I’m less interested in explaining systems than in participating with them: listening, adapting, interfering, making sense in motion.
	</p>

	<p>
		Philosophically, I’m drawn to affect, pattern, and transformation — to how things come to matter, and how attention shifts what’s possible. This has led me through music theory and machine learning, speculative design and football tactics, Deleuze &amp; Guattari and newborn care 👶 (which might actually be the most radical complexity lab of all).
	</p>

	<h2>Right now I’m exploring:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>🎼 Generative composition grounded in species counterpoint, jazz logic, and feedback</li>
		<li>🧠 Co-creative tools that support voice, neurodivergence, and embodied expression</li>
		<li>🌈 Visual-sonic mappings that blur the line between perception and modulation</li>
		<li>🌍 Collective sensemaking infrastructures like MassSense and the Cynefin framework</li>
		<li>📡 The poetics of interference — sonically, socially, personally</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		This blog is an open process: part sketchbook 📝, part field report 🗺️, part improvisation 🎷.<br />
		It’s where ideas gather, glitch, and sometimes harmonise.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thanks for listening. Let’s stay in the noise.
